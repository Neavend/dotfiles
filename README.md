# dotfiles
### My dotfiles for unix-based systems
### Running 'install.sh' automatically makes the symlinks to the files in this folder.
(It is inspired by EPITA's AFS configuration script)
Be sure to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to download dependancies
to install supplementary ressources (such as VIM plugins)
